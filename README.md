# portfolio_login
Portfolio Login for Drupal 8 administration. 
Custom admin paths with D8 custom module. The routes are defined in module's settings.
This is a module for fun, to learn and test all functionnalities provided by Drupal and Symfony.
A real contrib module is available for production if you want, but not created by me.

# Installation
 - Put the module into your module folder.
 - Set your custom routes in config files (Config API Drupal) in src/install folder.
 - Enable the module in Drupal BO.
 - Test your new routes :)

# Roadmap
 - Create an admin form to configure your login routes anytime (01/18)
 - Define routes for all admin path (2018)
